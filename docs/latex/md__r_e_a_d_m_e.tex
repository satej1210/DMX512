This project uses the T\+M4\+C123\+G\+XL Launchpad from Texas Instruments, which features a T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM A\+RM processor. This processor is a feature-\/packed processor and in this project, we attempt to explore some of the functionality it offers, by setting it up as a D\+M\+X-\/512 Controller and Receiver. The Launchpad is also connected to a S\+N75\+H\+V\+D12 R\+S-\/485 transceiver, which allows the D\+MX data to be effortlessly used by 512 devices, by connecting it to the data lines in parallel over a long distance. The Launchpad sends signals to the transceiver by utilizing the U\+A\+R\+T1 module on the T\+M4\+C123\+G\+H6\+PM processor. Similar setups are made where one module is a controller and the rest are devices. For the code, a reference manual is attached with this project report which contains descriptions of all variables and functions and what they are used for.
